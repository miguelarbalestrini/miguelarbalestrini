## ✨ About me ✨

I love learning new things, the main feature that I love about this industry is the tons of technologies out there.

I'm always trying to learn and understand, on a certain level, how all the cool things are built in this new era.
In this endless journey, I was able to get my hands on C, C #, C ++, Haskell, Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, SASS, Bootstrap, React, Redux, Material-UI, Unity, and React Native.

There are too many technologies and I have a long way to go to improve, but I think the most powerful skill I can develop is the flexibility to learn and adapt to very different contexts because everything will change over the years.
